## CS416 Final Project - Narrative Visualization


### Messaging
The project helps to visualize fuel economy of different cars by there fuel type and engine type.
### Narrative Structure
The project utilizes interactive slide show structure.  There are three slides. The first one shows an overall distribution of all the cars.  The second slide used different color for different fuel types, showing different trends between different fuel types.  The third slide used different color for different number of engine cylinders, highlighting the clusters between more engine cylinder and less engine cylinder.  All three slides also support drill-down and explore.  The first slide allow user to hoover over a data point and see the detail of this car.  The second and third allow user to hoover over one category and hide other categories so that they can see the trend more clearly.
### Visual Structure
The project uses slide show and annotated charts.  On top of each slide, there is a paragraph that introduce the reader to the topic of fuel economy which helps them to understand the context.  Below the paragraph is the annotated chart that is big enough to quickly draws the user’s attention.  When multiple colors appear, a legend was on side of the chart to aid understanding.  Annotations are on the graph to remind user the opportunity to drill-down, and highlight important trend that can be seen on the chart.  There are buttons that help users to navigate through the slides.  The slide has similar structure and only differs by how the data are categorized, which helps users to connects the ideas between each scene.
### Scenes
First scene is an overall trend that gives the user an impression of the number range of car MPF, and an idea of the relationship between Average Highway MPG and Average City MPG.  After the overall introduction, the second slide shows the difference between different type of fuels. This is because when people think of different fuel efficiency, fuel type would be the most obvious and straightforward.  The third slide is the difference between more engine cylinders and less engine cylinders, shows the user a less noticed factor that can also have impact on fuel efficiency.
### Annotations
Each scene has different annotations.  There are two types of annotation.  One reminds the user of some actions they can take, such as hoovering their mouse over the data points.  Others give more information about the dataset, such as specific values of a data point, or trends of the charts.
### Parameters
Parameters include highway MPG, city MPG, fuel type, and number of engine cylinders.  User can examine these parameters and see trends between them.
### Triggers
The project includes two types of triggers.  The first type is buttons below the introduction paragraph that allow the user to navigate the slide show.  When clicking on the buttons, it will go to the specific page.  Affordance is shown by making the button for the current page look like it is lower or darker, telling the user that the page has been pressed and should choose another page.  Another trigger is “mouse over” and “mouse out”.  Hoovering over one category allows the user to hide other categories so they can better visualize the trend or cluster.
